Certainly! Here's an example of a simple raffle web application using Python and the Flask framework. This application allows users to enter a raffle by submitting their names and email addresses, and at the end of the raffle, a random winner is selected and displayed.

First, make sure you have Python and Flask installed. You can install Flask by running `pip install flask` in your terminal.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import random

app = Flask(__name__)
participants = []

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/raffle', methods=['POST'])
def raffle():
    name = request.form['name']
    email = request.form['email']
    participants.append({'name': name, 'email': email})
    return 'You have been entered into the raffle!'

@app.route('/draw')
def draw_winner():
    if not participants:
        return 'No participants in the raffle yet.'

    winner = random.choice(participants)
    return f'The winner is: {winner["name"]} ({winner["email"]})'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Create a new folder for your project and save the code above into a file called `app.py`. Additionally, create a folder called `templates` and inside it, create an HTML file called `index.html` with the following contents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Raffle</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Raffle Entry</h1>
    <form action="/raffle" method="POST">
        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required><br>

        <label for="email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br>

        <input type="submit" value="Enter Raffle">
    </form>
    <br>
    <a href="/draw">Draw Winner</a>
</body>
</html>
```

To run the web app, open a terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run the command `python app.py`. You should see an output similar to:

```
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the raffle entry form. Enter the participant's name and email address and click "Enter Raffle." Once you have some participants, you can click "Draw Winner" to select a random winner from the entered participants.

Please note that this is a basic example, and there are many additional features you can add to enhance the raffle web app, such as validation, error handling, and persisting data to a database.
